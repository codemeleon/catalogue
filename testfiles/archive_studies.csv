CafGEN,Collaborative African Genomics Network,Case-Control,"Genomic studies have become one of the potential tools that could aid in the understanding disease. HIV disease progression and active TB infection have been studied using these genomic methods to interrogate host factors associated with these diseases and their progression. Prior work has focused on adult populations and limited African cohorts. The Collaborative African Genomics Network aims to fill this gap by conducting HIV and TB disease mapping studies in African children to understand how genetic variation impacts disease progression through the use of genomic technologies. A cohort of 1000 well-phenotyped paediatric perinatally HIV-infected patients has been recruited at 2 Baylor International Paediatric AIDS Initiative Centres of Excellence in Botswana and Uganda. 200 long-term non progressors (LTNP) - not needing antiretroviral treatment or asymptomatic for HIV disease 10 years after perinatal infection, and 200 rapid progressors (RP) samples â€“ having two or more CD4 T cell percentage values <15% within three years after birth, with no value >15% afterwards in the absence of ART; and/or ART initiated within three years after birth, and at least one preceding CD4<15%; and/or AIDS-defining illness (CDC category 3 or WHO stage 3/4), will be utilised in the discovery of novel and known variants associated with HIV disease progression. Candidate variants from the discovery phase will be replicated with the other 300 LTNP/RP samples.",314,141,173,12544524A,Whole Exome Sequencing data from a retrospective paediatric HIV-disease progression cohort defined on the World Health Organization's criteria for paediatric HIV progression.
